                <h1>ABOUT <span>ELYSA</span></h1>
                <h2>FOUNDER OF GLAMBYELISA</h2>
                <p>CT & NY licensed Skincare Specialist, Eyebrow Contouring and makeup artist based in Connecticut </p>
                <p>Elysa's passionate journey with makeup has begun in her early teen's age, thanks to her older sisters who routinely asked her to do their hair and create unique looks with makeup ever since Elysa has developed a passion for creativity and the satisfaction from helping people look at their best. 
                Throughout her career just to name a few she has enjoyed working for L.A Productions and entertainment, film director Wayne Holmes, numerous photographers, and Beauty at Your Door, providing on-location makeup services for brides and she has as well donated her services to local events for charities as a way to give back to the community.
                </p>
                <p>Her early teen experience planted the seeds for her to pursue a career in makeup when she moved to New York City back in 2001. Later, drawing inspiration from "ABOUTFACE" Scott Barnes book (celebrity makeup artist) which talks about the secret of great make up is to have healthy skin; Elysa became a skincare specialist.</p>
                <p>Having a great canvas to work on it's the core to great make up which consequently asserted the value of offering facial treatments for every skin type and condition. </p>
                <p>Therefore, GLAMBYELYSA offers a bar equipped with the most advanced facial treatments which allows us to help our clients' skin to look young and healthy every day-- not just on their best days. </p>
                <p>Today, at GLAMBYELYSA our utmost joy is to observe your satisfaction with the variety of services we offer especially creating looks for brides on the most special day of their lives with our premier bridal services, event and commercial makeup artistry. </p>
                <p>We believe the key success factor for a makeup artist is to understand the woman's style and personality in order to creating a look that truly reflects them while enhancing their best features. 
                In addition to makeup and skincare one of Elysa's specialties is eyebrow shaping and contouring which dramatically accentuates the features of the face in the most flattering way.
